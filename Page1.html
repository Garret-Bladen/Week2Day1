    <h2>Here are my top three favorite foods!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sushi... especially the spicy rolls. However, it didn't help that I worked at Tsunami where I got 50% off.
        </li>
        <li>
            A nice medium-rare steak
        </li>
        <li>
            Ramen... not the crappy ramen. Good ramen, from an actual ramen place.
        </li>
    </ol>
